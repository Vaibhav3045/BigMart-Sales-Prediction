# BigMart-Sales-Prediction
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and predictive modeling project for BigMart sales data. The main objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the sales of products in various BigMart stores.

# Project Overview
The project involves the following key steps:

1. Data Preparation

  * Loading and inspecting the data

  * Handling missing values

  * Encoding categorical variables

  * Feature engineering to create new meaningful features

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

  * Analyzing the distribution of target and predictor variables

  * Identifying relationships between different variables

  * Visualizing important patterns and insights

3. Data Wrangling and Feature Engineering

  * Cleaning and transforming the data to prepare it for modeling

  * Creating new features to improve model performance

4. Modeling

  * Splitting the data into training and testing sets

  * Training a XGBoost regressor model

  * Evaluating the model performance using R-squared and RMSE metrics

5. Feature Importance Analysis

  * Identifying the most important features that contribute to the prediction

# Results

R2 Score: 0.5423

RMSE Score: 1132.22

These results indicate that the model can explain approximately 54.23% of the variance in the sales data, with an RMSE of 1132.22.

# Visualizations
Feature Importance Plot: This plot shows the importance of each feature in the predictive model, highlighting which features have the most impact on sales predictions.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates building a sales prediction model using machine learning techniques. The model provides valuable insights into the factors that influence sales and can be used to make data-driven decisions for inventory management and sales strategies.
